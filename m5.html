<h2>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>

<h2>ULTIMATE CONTROL.</h2>
<p>Incomparable stability and control is achieved thanks to the new M xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive system – unique to the all-new BMW M5. The system features a pronounced rear-wheel bias and can be adjusted between three modes – 4WD, 4WD Sport, and 2WD – for ideal performance on racetracks and highways alike.</p>

<h2>LIGHTER. STRONGER.</h2>
<p>Less weight means increased performance. The contoured Carbon Fiber Reinforced
Plastic roof of the new BMW M5 lowers the center of gravity and dramatically reduces weight. You’ll feel the difference when you’re wringing every ounce of power out of the upgraded 4.4-liter V-8 with M TwinPower Turbo technology.</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE COMPONENTS.</h2>
<p>Designed for more than looks. The BMW M5 Competition Sedan shows off its attitude and ambition in every asset. With a chassis that’s enhanced and lowered to improve driving dynamics and the added power transfer of M xDrive all-wheel drive, you’ll benefit from every bit of this beauty’s 617 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque in a 0-60 mph time of just 3.1 seconds.</p>

<h2>RELENTLESS FOCUS.</h2>
<p>All for the driver. Everything about the BMW M5 centers on the driving experience. With impressive standard features like Icon Adaptive Full LED Headlights, Park Distance Control, and M-specific additions to the 12.3" Dynamic Digital Instrument Cluster and Head-Up Display, this is one vehicle that guarantees a dynamic driving experience.</p>

<h2>REAR STYLE.</h2>
<p>Distinctive from all sides. The rear design of the new BMW M5 includes a weight-optimized exhaust system with quad tailpipes, a subtle M rear spoiler, and an M rear apron with diffuser. The BMW M5 Competition Sedan includes the M Sport exhaust system with distinctive black tailpipes – a perfect complement to other black elements, including the kidney grille, mirror caps, side gills, and more.</p>

<h2>SHIFTING CHARACTERISTICS.</h2>
<p>Power in your hand. Adjust your shift times with the Drivelogic buttons on the new M gearshift lever. Selecting between three Drivelogic modes changes the performance of the new eight-speed M Steptronic transmission in the BMW M5 from efficient and comfortable to ultra-fast and race-ready.</p>
