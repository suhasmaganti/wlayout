<h1>M</h1>
<h1>THE MOST POWERFUL LETTER IN THE WORLD.</h1>

<p>Packed with power normally reserved for the track, M generates performance unlike anything else. And after four decades of delivering hair-raising thrills, it’s still pushing the limits. But don’t just take our word for it. Grip the wheel of any of our eight M models—from coupes to convertibles to Sports Activity Vehicles® – and elevate your adrenaline rushes to a whole new level.</p> </div>

<h2>DYNAMIC ENGINEERING</h2>

<h3>BUILT FOR WHITE-KNUCKLE THRILLS.</h3>
<p>At the heart of every M is advanced BMW engineering. Intelligent lightweight materials—including Carbon Fiber—reduce weight for optimum agility. State-of-the-art TwinTurbo technology also ensures a lighter body by decreasing the number of cylinders, while still delivering greater than 100 horsepower per liter.</p>

<h2>AGGRESSIVELY POWERFUL</h2>

<h3>YES, IT'S STREET LEGAL.</h3>
<p>Meet the race car you can drive every day. Its blistering power is matched with responsible handling to deliver track- level performance that you can measure with unique tools like the M Laptimer app with GoPro integration. This tool analyzes your driving style on closed courses and is designed to help improve your lap times.</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE HISTORY</h2>

<h3>WHERE POWER WAS BORN.</h3>
<p>It all started on the track in 1972. What began as a division for BMW’s racing teams quickly grew to become an incredible passion for many BMW enthusiasts. Its on-track success spurred the world’s most coveted high-performance vehicles: the original M1, the iconic E30 M3, and most recently, the intensely thrilling M2.</p>
